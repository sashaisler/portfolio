            <p>Hi! I'm Sasha Isler and I'm currently studying at Columbia University, majoring in Computer Engineering. 
            My passion for engineering has led me to gain skills and experience in software development, 3D printing and CAD 
            design, and circuits analysis, and I'm always eager to learn more and apply my new knowledge! </p>

            <h2 class="modal-title">Mini Musical Chairs</h2>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Mini Musical Chairs is a game that was created by me and a team of three other people for a class assignment. 
                We were given the semester to create a game using an Arduino and showcase our project at an expo at the 
                conclusion of the semester. Our project is a variation on musical chairs that allows for the game to be 
                played with your fingers. My contribution was writing the code, which was done in the Arduino IDE using C++, 
                the wiring, CADing, and 3D Printing, in addition to aiding in the overall assembly of the project and contributing 
                to the presentation at the expo. </p>
            <p>Github Project: https://github.com/sisler101/Mini-Musical-Chairs</p>
            <h3>Components:</h3>
            <p>The project included:

                Two Arduinos (used two to solve power issues that arose from having many components)
                
                LCD Display
                
                Three buttons (add, subtract, enter)
                
                Speaker
                
                LED Strip
                
                Four Servo Motors
                
                Five 3D printed chairs
                
                Four 3D printed connectors to attach the servo motors to the chairs
                
                Laser Cut box made from wood</p>

            <h2 class="modal-title">ToSendList</h2>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>ToSend List is a climbing themed to do list I created using HTML and JavaScript. 
                It is currently published on the Chrome Web Store and is available to add to your Chrome for free. 
                Not only does it have the basic functionalities of a to do list (add, delete, and mark tasks as complete), 
                it also allows you to grade your tasks on the bouldering scale (supports both V-Scale and Font-Scale).</p>
            <h3>Motivation:</h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by two of my obsessions: rock climbing and to do lists. 
                I have been rock climbing for 6 years now and even competed on a youth team when I was younger. 
                I am also always jotting things down on to do lists, whether in my reminders app, notes app, or on a post-it. 
                To do lists are the only way I manage to stay organized and on top of my tasks. I realized, why not combine 
                my passion for climbing with my favorite productivity tool? And thats when ToSend List was born. </p>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Crazy Eights is an Uno like game I coded in Java that is played in the terminal. 
                This game was an assignment for my Intro to Java class. Check it out on my Github!</p>
