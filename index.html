            <h2 class="modal-title">Mini Musical Chairs</h2>
            <p>Mini Musical Chairs is a game I developed with team of three other students as part of a class assignment. We were tasked with building a game using an Arduino over the course of a semester to be showcased at an end-of-semester expo. I led my team in creating our project: a finger-operated adaptation of musical chairs, designed for engaging gameplay through simple hand movements.</p>
            <p>My contributions included writing the Arduino code for the servo motors and overall game play logic, constructing the circuitry, designing the CAD models, and 3D printing the components. Additionally, I managed task workflows and delegated responsibilities to team members, ensuring that the project remained on schedule and was completed in time for the expo.</p>

            <dl style="margin: 0;">
                <dd>- Two Arduinos</dd>
                <dd>- LCD Display</dd>
                <dd>- Three buttons (add, subtract, enter)</dd>
                <dd>- Speaker</dd>
                <dd>- LED Strip</dd>
                <dd>- Four Servo Motors (five not needed since at least one chair will always be in play)</dd>
                <dd>- Five 3D printed chairs</dd>
                <dd>- Four 3D printed connectors to attach the servo motors to the chairs</dd>
                <dd>- Laser Cut box made from wood</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>The Arduino was unable to power all the components we were using, and since we had already exhausted our budget, we decided to use a second Arduino that was already accessible to us. The two Arduinos were implemented using a leader/follower system.</p>

            <p>ToSend List is a climbing themed to do list I created using HTML and JavaScript. 
                It is currently published on the Chrome Web Store and is available for free. 
                Not only does it have the basic functionalities of a to do list (add, delete, and mark tasks as complete), 
                it also allows you to grade your tasks on the bouldering scale (supports both V-Scale and Font-Scale).</p>

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by two of my obsessions: rock climbing and to-do lists. 
                Throughout my daily life, I am dedicated to staying organized and consistently use to-do lists, whether on paper post-its or digital apps. 
                When I'm not at school or engaged with other responsibilities, you can find me at the nearest rock climbing gym. 
                I have been an avid rock climber for seven years, competing at both Youth and Collegiate levels. 
                Recognizing the potential to combine these two interests, I developed ToSend List, seamlessly merging my enthusiasm for climbing with my commitment to productivity.</p>

            <p>Crazy Eights is an Uno like game I coded in Java that is played in the terminal. 
                This game was an assignment for my Intro to Java class. Check it out on my Github!</p>
